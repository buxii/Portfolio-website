# Aniol Buxeda's Portfolio Website

## Project Analysis

### User Profile: User Persona
This portfolio website is designed for Aniol Buxeda Pascual, a computer engineering student with a passion for software engineering, collaboration, and technical challenges. Aniol aims to showcase his skills, academic background, and work experience in a structured and visually appealing way. The primary user of this website is Aniol himself, as the site will act as his professional online presence for potential recruiters, future colleagues, and peers to explore his portfolio, skills, and experiences. Aniol seeks to convey a professional yet approachable persona, emphasizing his expertise in software engineering and his collaborative spirit. This website also provides a point of reference for demonstrating his work on projects such as his Arch Linux setup and final year project (he only put some projects as examples).

### Information Architecture
The website is divided into three main sections: **Index**, **About Me**, and **Projects**. The **Index** section serves as the landing page, containing navigation links and social media icons to establish contact or explore further. The **About Me** section provides detailed information about Aniol, including his personal background, skills, experience, and academic achievements. This section uses clickable containers, each leading to a detailed pop-up with relevant information, ensuring a concise layout that avoids overwhelming the user. The **Projects** section includes descriptions of Aniol's projects, presented in individual containers that link directly to the GitHub repositories. This allows for easy navigation and exploration of Aniol's work without requiring excessive scrolling or clicking through nested menus. The use of pop-ups and clickable containers keeps the interface clean and ensures a better user experience. Scrolling is disabled to maintain a clean user interface, and navigation is facilitated by scroll buttons that smoothly transition between sections, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Visual Design
The visual design of the website reflects a minimalistic and professional style. The website features a gradient background that conveys a sense of elegance and consistency throughout the different sections, transitioning smoothly from one area to the next. The **Index** section utilizes larger profile pictures with hover animations to attract attention, accompanied by social media icons enclosed in a sleek grey container. This design choice emphasizes Aniol's personality and makes the introduction memorable. The **About Me** section features six containers, each with a transparent, slightly rounded box. Clicking on a container displays a detailed pop-up, allowing users to focus on specific areas of Aniol's profile without scrolling excessively. The **Projects** section follows a similar approach, with individual project containers linking to GitHub repositories. The visual design uses subtle hover effects, gradient backgrounds, and color-coded language indicators to make the information both visually appealing and easily digestible. The use of "DM Sans" font adds a sense of readability and simplicity, supporting a professional look across the entire site.
